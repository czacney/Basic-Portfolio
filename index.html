    <p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Casey Zacney and I am from Phoenixville, PA, a suburb of the Greater Philadelphia Area. I attended college and graduated with a B.A. in Environmental Studies with a focus in the humanities. My passion is to bring awareness and solutions to the general public concerning the environment and fighting for environmental justice.

    <br>
    <p>I decided to join the Penn LPS Coding Boot Camp to get into the world of eco-tech, as I hope to use technology to educate people about ongoing environmental issues as well as hopefully help find solutions for those problems.
